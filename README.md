# sample-selector
This one was used to select tumor samples with the most extreme (either very strong or very weak) drug responses given an input table. 

UNFORTUNATELY this was only part of the code used to combine/prune some columns. The rest was lost when I was reorganizing some files on my computer. Only making that mistake once ðŸ’€
